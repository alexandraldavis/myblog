Hello, thank you for checking out my personal blog. I'm Alexandra.

I live in Saint Louis, where I am currently pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering. I earned a degree in molecular engineering with a minor in Germanic 
studies from the University of Chicago in 2019. 

My interests outside of the lab include music, foreign languages, history, philosophy, physical fitness, traveling, and digital privacy. After college 
graduation I started itching to revive non-scientific writing, so expect that here.

Feel free to connect with me via [email](mailto:bagsy@posteo.de).
