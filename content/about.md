Hi, I'm Alexandra. Thank you for visiting my personal blog. 

I currently live in Saint Louis, where I am pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 with my 
bachelor's in molecular engineering and a minor in Germanic studies.

I have many interests outside of the lab, including music, reading, photography, foreign languages, physical fitness, philosophy, travel, and digital 
privacy. After college I started itching to revive non-scientific writing, so expect posts on these topics and more.

If you want to follow along without remembering to check this website , you can subscribe to my blog's [RSS feed](https://bagsy.blog/index.xml). 
[Here is why RSS feeds are so great](https://aboutfeeds.com/). My favorite feed reader is [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), but there are many free 
alternatives. Feel free to [email me](mailto:bagsy@posteo.me) if you'd like to get in touch.
