Let's play a game of finding out how many high schoolers make me feel bad about myself. Just kidding. Mostly.

National STEM competitions and debate tournaments are some of many opportunities for teenagers to flaunt their brilliance. To call such talent 
astounding is an understatement.

The winner of this year's Regeneron Science Talent Search contest [developed a matching theory based on the Gale-Shapley 
algorithm.](http://www.yau-science-awards.org/upload/202011/09/202011091102254801/202011091102254801.pdf) This theoretical matchmaker, however, 
pairs not a finite but rather an infinite number of potential couples. Don't ask me how that works.

[An NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/18/978721494/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-an-algorithm-stem-contest-winner-pairs-data) features not only Choi's victory but also her future plans, which include studying math at Harvard. I point out this spectacle not 
because it just so happens to be recent news. After all, someone else shared it with me a few days ago. Yet this same person, while they 
celebrated this student's accomplishment, also chided her. I hope you are as confused by that as I was.

The critic stressed that this decision is suboptimal because she passed up Stanford, which a "Nobel Prize dynasty" (their words, not mine) in her 
field of interest calls home. That environment would benefit her more. Worse, this suggests that she is not genuinely interested in economics and 
undertook the project only to gain acceptance to a prestigious university.

I am not interested in listing pragmatic challenges of sending teenagers on one-way Hyper-Specialization Road. Anyone familiar with recruiting 
faculty members, hiring post-docs, or applying to graduate school understands how this approach can fail. This critique is dangerous beyond 
practical reasons.

As if she chose community college over Stanford. As if choosing where to study is not multifaceted. As if someone cannot have more than one 
academic interest. As if this eighteen year-old girl's life can only spiral downwards from here.

I dislike playing futile ping-pong online, whether that be via forums or email. Though I realized we had opposing views on higher education, I 
tried peeling this person's philosophy to the core, unsurprisingly to no avail. I still cannot resist ranting about their opinion's absurdity 
days afterwards.

I fear a world where we value universities solely for their career advancement services or the number of graduates who land a tenure-track 
position at a top X university within 7.64 years post-graduation. I'm not saying that those things are unimportant, that college is an 
insignificant economic investment, or that admissions should be a lottery. But that we could and SHOULD predict in a formulaic way which 17/18 
year-old will benefit most from a high-quality education, based on their likelihood of using specific resources according to some compulsory, 
"optimized", and specialized path drilled in their brains since freshman year of high school, to maybe possibly perhaps by chance win a Nobel 
Prize or earn 1000+ citations from a single Nature article or achieve some other noble feat, does not sit well with me.
